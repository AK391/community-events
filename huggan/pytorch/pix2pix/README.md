# Train Pix2pix on your custom data

This folder contains a script to train [pix2pix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004), leveraging the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) ecosystem for processing data and pushing the model to the Hub.

The script leverages ðŸ¤— Datasets for loading and processing data, and ðŸ¤— Accelerate for instantly running on CPU, single, multi-GPUs or TPU, also supporting mixed precision.

To train the model with the default parameters (200 epochs, 256x256 images, etc.) on [huggan/facades](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggan/facades) on your environment, first run:

```bash
accelerate config
```

and answer the questions asked. Next, launch the script as follows: 

```
accelerate launch train.py
```

This will create local "images" and "saved_models" directories, containing generated images and saved checkpoints over the course of the training.

To train on another dataset available on the hub, simply do (for instance):

```
accelerate launch train.py --dataset huggan/night2day
```

Make sure to pick a dataset which has "imageA" and "imageB" columns defined. One can always tweak the script in case the column names are different.

## Training on your own data

You can of course also train on your own images. For this, one can leverage Datasets' [ImageFolder](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.0.0/en/image_process#imagefolder). Make sure to authenticate with the hub first, either by running the `huggingface-cli login` command in a terminal, or the following in case you're working in a notebook:

```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

Next, run the following in a notebook/script:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# first: load dataset
# option 1: from local folder
dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_dir="path_to_folder")
# option 2: from remote URL (e.g. a zip file)
dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_files="URL to .zip file")

# optional: remove "label" column, in case there are no subcategories
dataset['train'] = dataset['train'].remove_columns(column_names="label")

# next: push to the hub (assuming git-LFS is installed)
dataset.push_to_hub("huggan/my-awesome-dataset")
```

You can then simply pass the name of the dataset to the script:

```
python train.py --dataset huggan/my-awesome-dataset
```
