# Blocks Competition

Happy to invite you to the Gradio Blocks sprint - a community event in which we will setup and deploy models using the new Gradio Blocks feature. Blocks allows you to build web-based demos in a flexible way using the Gradio library. Blocks is a more low-level and flexible alternative to the core Interface class. To Learn more about blocks, see link: [https://website-dev--helpful-fenglisu-2bc03b.netlify.app/introduction_to_blocks/](https://deploy-preview-1012--aesthetic-pothos-d466c6.netlify.app/introduction_to_blocks/) The event will take place from May 11th to 31st. We will be organizing this event on github and the huggingface discord channel.
