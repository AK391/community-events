# Example scripts

This directory contains a few example scripts that allow you to train famous GANs on your own data using a bit of ðŸ¤— magic.

More concretely, these scripts:
- leverage ðŸ¤— [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) to load any image dataset from the hub (including your own, possibly private, dataset)
- leverage ðŸ¤— [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) to instantly run the script on CPU, (multi-) GPU, TPU environments, supporting fp16 and mixed precision
- leverage ðŸ¤— [Hub](https://huggingface.co/) to push the model to the hub at the end of training, allowing to easily create a demo for it afterwards

Currently, it contains the following examples:
