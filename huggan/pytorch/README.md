This directory contains a few example scripts that allow you to train famous GANs on your own data using a bit of ðŸ¤— magic.

More concretely, these scripts:
- leverage ðŸ¤— Datasets to load any image dataset from the hub (including your own, possibly private, dataset)
- leverage ðŸ¤— Accelerate to instantly run the script on (multi-) GPU environments, supporting fp16 and mixed precision
- leverage ðŸ¤— Hub to push the model to the hub at the end of training, allowing to easily create a demo for it afterwards
