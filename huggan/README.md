_**Timeline**: April 4th, 2020 - April 17th, 2020_

---

Welcome to HugGAN Sprint! The goal of this sprint is to add more GANs and GAN-based demos to the Hugging Face Hub ü§ó.

During the sprint, we‚Äôll be bringing in some awesome speakers to talk about GANs and the future of generative models. Oh, and if you need access to compute for your project, we‚Äôll help you there too! As an added bonus, if you choose to participate, we‚Äôll send you a gift (specific details TBD). We encourage you to form teams of ~2-3 people! Make friends in the Discord :)


To join:

1. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/goq41UgzsvuKKTFFA), so we can keep track of who‚Äôs joining.
2. Send a reaction in the #join-sprint channel under the HugGAN category in Discord. This will add you to the rest of the related channels. If you haven't joined our discord yet, [click here](discord.gg/H3bUrDPTfS).
3. Once you‚Äôve decided what you want to work on, add your project‚Äôs information to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAHqOOk2SOw4j6mrJLkLT6ZyKyLDOvGF5D9tuUqnoG8/edit#gid=0), where you can describe your project and let us know if you need additional compute. Still brainstorming? Feel free to propose ideas in #sprint-discussions.

## Submissions

For each submission, you are expected to submit:

1. A model repository
2. A space made with the model repository you created

### Adding a Model

Model repositories are expected to have a full model card üÉè that includes:
- license,
- task,
- dataset metadata,
- information related to the model,
- information on dataset, intended uses,
- a model output.

Models can be either trained by you, or ones that are available you‚Äôd like to share with the community. If you didn‚Äôt train the model yourself, be sure to both credit the original authors and include the associated license in your model card! Here is an [example model repo](https://huggingface.co/merve/anime-faces-generator).

Don't know how to share a model? Check out [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/adding-a-model#adding-your-model-to-the-hugging-face-hub)!

### Adding a Space

Once you share a model, you then should share a [Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces) based on your SDK of choice (gradio or streamlit) or as a static page. üåå

Here is an [example Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/merve/anime-face-generator) corresponding to the model example shared above. Don‚Äôt know how to create a space? Read more about how to add spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces).
