# HugGAN Sprint

![Banner](assets/huggan_banner.png?raw=true "Banner")

_**Timeline**: April 4th, 2020 - April 17th, 2020_

---

Welcome to HugGAN Sprint! The goal of this sprint is to add more GANs and GAN-based demos to the Hugging Face Hub ü§ó.

During the sprint, we‚Äôll be bringing in some awesome speakers to talk about GANs and the future of generative models. Oh, and if you need access to compute for your project, we‚Äôll help you there too! As an added bonus, if you choose to participate, we‚Äôll send you a gift (specific details TBD). We encourage you to form teams of ~2-3 people! Make friends in the Discord :)

To join:

1. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/goq41UgzsvuKKTFFA), so we can keep track of who‚Äôs joining.
2. Send a reaction in the #join-sprint channel under the HugGAN category in Discord. This will add you to the rest of the related channels. If you haven't joined our discord yet, [click here](discord.gg/H3bUrDPTfS).
3. Once you‚Äôve decided what you want to work on, add your project‚Äôs information to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAHqOOk2SOw4j6mrJLkLT6ZyKyLDOvGF5D9tuUqnoG8/edit#gid=0), where you can describe your project and let us know if you need additional compute. Still brainstorming? Feel free to propose ideas in #sprint-discussions.

## General worfklow

The process to follow is outlined below. It consists of 3 steps:

1. Get a dataset and push to hub
2. Train a model and push to hub
3. Create a demo (ü§ó Space)

These steps are explained in more detail below.

### 1. Get a dataset and push to hub

The first step is the most obvious one: to train a GAN (or any neural network), we need a dataset. This could be a standard one that is already available on the [hub](hf.co) (such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, etc.) or it could be one that's not already on the hub, for instance one that you collected yourself.

In the format case, you can easily load a dataset as follows:


```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("mnist")
```

In the latter case, it's required to upload the dataset to the hub, as part of the `huggan` organization. For this, we can leverage the [`ImageFolder`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.0.0/en/image_process#imagefolder) builder which was added recently to the Datasets library. 
```

First, load your image dataset as a `Dataset` object:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# option 1: local folder
dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_dir="path_to_folder")
# option 2: local or remote file(s
dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_files="path_to_zip")
```

Once you've loaded your dataset, you can check it out:

```python
dataset
```

Next, you can push it to the hub. To do this, make sure git-LFS is installed and that you're authenticated with the hub. 

If you're working in a notebook (such as Google Colab), installing git-LFS can be done as follows:

```bash
! sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

Authenticating with the hub can be done as follows:

```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

Finally, you can push your dataset to the hub as follows:

```python
dataset.push_to_hub("huggan/name-of-your-dataset")
```

### 2. Train a model and push to hub

Next, one can start training a model. This could be any model you'd like. However, we do provide some examples to help you get started, in both PyTorch and Keras.

An example is the [DCGAN]() model. Simply follow the README that explains all the details of the relevant implementation.

If you're planning to train a PyTorch model, it's recommended to make it inherit from `PyTorchModelHubMixin`. This makes sure you can push it to the hub at the end of training as follows:

```python
model.push_to_hub("huggan/name-of-your-model").
```

In Keras, one can leverage the `push_to_hub_keras` method.

Model repositories are expected to have a full model card üÉè that includes:
- license,
- task,
- dataset metadata,
- information related to the model,
- information on dataset, intended uses,
- a model output.

Models can be either trained by you, or ones that are available you‚Äôd like to share with the community. If you didn‚Äôt train the model yourself, be sure to both credit the original authors and include the associated license in your model card! Here is an [example model repo](https://huggingface.co/merve/anime-faces-generator).

Don't know how to share a model? Check out [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/adding-a-model#adding-your-model-to-the-hugging-face-hub)!

### 3. Create a demo

Once you share a model, you then should share a [Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces) based on your SDK of choice (Gradio or Streamlit) or as a static page. üåå

Here is an [example Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/merve/anime-face-generator) corresponding to the model example shared above. Don‚Äôt know how to create a space? Read more about how to add spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces).

## Submissions

For each submission, you are expected to submit:

1. A model repository
2. A space made with the model repository you created
